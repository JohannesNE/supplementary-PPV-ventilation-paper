Panels are arranged with tidal volumes (VT) in rows and respiratory rates (RR) in columns . One fluid challenge was evaluated for each subject (n = 50), while PPV~Classic~ was calculated for each of the 10 ventilator settings."

# Figure S2

(ref:fig2) Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves for capacity of pulse pressure variation (PPV) to classify fluid responsiveness (stroke volume change > 10%). Panels are arranged with tidal volumes (VT) in rows and respiratory rates (RR) in columns. One fluid challenge was evaluated for each subject (n = 50), while PPV~GAM~ and PPV~Classic~ was calculated for each of the 10 ventilator settings.

Grey areas are 95% confidence intervals for bias and LoA. The purple lines and areas are linear regression fits with 95% confidence intervals.

# Figure S4

(ref:fig4) (Extended version of the paper's Fig. 5): Parameter estimates for a Bayesian mixed-effects model, describing the effect of tidal volume (VT) and respiratory rate (RR) on pulse pressure variation (PPV). Parameters are estimated for both PPV derived using a generalized additive model (GAM) and using a classic approach (Classic). Panel **a** presents the observed PPV values (outcomes) using each method (n=507 for both GAM and Classic). Vertical bars are 95% compatibility intervals. Panel **b**, **c** and **d** present parameter estimates. Vertical bars are 95% compatibility intervals. Panel **e** shows model residuals, and panel **f** shows the residual variation relative to the estimated value of PPV.
